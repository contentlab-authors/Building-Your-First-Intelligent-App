While theyve served their purpose over the years and have gotten us through a lot of wonderful memories I can honestly say Im even more excited about the next decade of memories I hope to capture with this camera.This camera is quick. My wife was capturing images of seagulls and pelicans at the beach today and while not every image was perfect I would say that at least 3/4 of them were pretty close. We havent even tried the sport setting yet the camera seems to handle the action just fine on other settings.Coming from years of experience with point-and-shoot cameras and disposables it was refreshing to see the first batch of prints from a high-quality camera. I notice that the colors and lighting are coming through much richer than Im used to. Ive always wanted a camera that gives you that nice blurred background effect and depth of field - now I have one! My wife says that it makes all of our pictures look more professional.Now that I have a camera with modular lenses I can go out and buy new lenses that suit different situations. For example a long distance lens that can handle vast landscape shots or a close distance lens that can capture the minutia of a flower petal.The only negative that I can pin down so far regarding the functionality of the camera is that it can be a bit noisy at times. Its not obnoxiously loud but when the camera auto-focuses it will whine if youre too close. But I guess that just depends on what lens youre using. I still have a lot to learn about how to properly use a fancy camera like this.As a final note the battery on the camera seems to last a long time and I bought this camera used!

I searched for any Canon EOS series that supported Dual-Pixel Autofocus with live-tracking face-detection that would work well with the Canon EF-series lenses that I already have. This model (which is not the current model) meets all my needs and was available at significant discount compared to the newest T8i model (which has additional features I dont need).I paired this 800D body with the EF 35mm f/2 IS USM lens (which is equivalent to 50mm on a full-frame body). The face-detection autofocus is better and faster than my 5D IV or C100 II cinema cameras. It will track all the way to the edges of the image. Silent fast perfect focus continuously all day long.I use a dummy-battery with external adapter to power the camera from AC so I dont have to worry about battery life. The touchscreen flips-out and faces forward automatically flipping the image so I can monitor what the camera sees (with data overlay and focus box).I am not using the Auto white-balance. There are limited options for custom white balance on this model but I am using 5200K to match my light-source and the resulting color contrast skin-tones looks really excellent. This looks as good as the 5D IV at 6X lower price!Audio: When used as a webcam regardless of whether you connect an external mic or use the built-in mic - note that you will not get audio out of the USB webcam interface or the HDMI out. So plan on using some other source connected separately to your host computer for audio. This 800D will only provide the video. If you are looking for clean HDMI out it is only possible to get this by turning-off all menu/info displays AND switching-off autofocus. If you need the autofocus (the whole point of using the camera) then the HDMI out will have focus overlays. So I would not recommend using this as an HDMI webcam. The EOS Webcam utility over USB works very well but does have noticeable latency. If you have the ability to delay your audio to the host then you can get perfect lip-sync even with the latency of the USB interface.I have not used this as an everyday DSLR but I am quite impressed at the nice build-quality great image quality and nice compact size.

I mean why not get all the advantage you can? Thats what the Carl Zeiss lens does much of the work. I took this camera to Hawaii and with little study of the complete manual (I did read the Quck Start guide thoroughly) I got what were called coffee table book shots. And that comment came from a friend who *teaches* photography and Photoshop at a local community college. THATs how good this camera with that lens in it is.Some of my pictures were made using various settings that I manually adjusted using the cameras Manual settings or Programmed settings. (I have MUCH to learn about the various combo possibilities of shtter speed white balance aperture etc.!) But many great shots were made merely by selecting the point-and-shoot mode and letting the camera do the work.The 7+ megapixels (I rarely use 7; usually I use 5) means that youll have the option of cropping out unwanted or uninteresting areas of any picture you take and still have a great high-density photo left to work with. It also means that digitial editing software has a lot of information to work with.I also love the full-frame video. Nothing beats being able merely to flip to the movie setting press the shutter button and instantly be taking a movie. And youre not limited by a pre-defined length; youre only limited by the remaining capacity on your memory card. (I *highly* recommend getting a 1G card; youll never miss the money and youll love having so much storage capacity to work with.)I did a lot of research before buyig a camera.

It can only be used for near or just signing into your account just to see whats going on. Its not reliable for much else sadly. Also $30 dollars per month is a bit expensive for most so take that into consideration. (NOTE: This is my personal opinion on the 3G man others may have enjoyed it just not me)The only competitor to this is the 3DS which I believe is left in the dust by this piece of heaven. There is a QUAD core processor in the Vita. Thats right. 4 processors. Thats better than the ipad 2. The screen is a 5in OLED touch screen with a rear touch panel to interact with games. Its HD screen looks marvelous. Watching a video on youtube does not justify the excellence of the screen. You can just look at comparison videos of the 2 consoles for yourself to see.All in all This console deserves a 9.5/10.

I am writing this on 11/20/2010 and both my 10Ds work great and are 10 or more years old. Alot of people decide they want to try photography and spend over $1000.00 and the camera ends up in the bag getting hardly any use at all. Or the person loses interest completely and ends up selling the camera and losing alot of what they paid. The Canon 10D is the perfect entry level DSLR. They last and take great pictures. Try not to get caught up in the Megapixel game because 5 to 10 megapixels is all A hobbyist photographer really needs. 5 to 10 megapixels print beautiful 8by 10 prints and I have printed many beautiful prints with my Canon 10D. Remember your gonna also need to buy lenses and lenses are very important for DSLR cameras. My advise to someone starting out would be a Canon 50mm.

I have been using this system with Olympus OM series lenses which in my humble opinion render light beautifully and are almost as sharp as M-series Leica lenses and they make the entire system considerably more portable and less obtrusive than using the body with standard Canon lenses.The larger sensor also accommodates low light photography far greater than standard cropped sensor DSLRs and most compact digital cameras - which I really enjoy. Imagine: shooting pictures at night! With this you can and your pictures wont carry excessive noise at the higher ISOs. 1600 actually looks nice!Check out some of my shots using this set up on my flickr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/adamhuggins/Overall this is the most versatile and high quality/performance body I can afford at the moment and it actually works out to be cheaper than my last cropped sensor DSLR.Besides the costs using the camera in this way has really brought the joy back into photography that I used to feel when I was shooting with my old manual Olympus OM series cameras and lenses which Ive lost since using most of the conventional cropped sensor DSLRs with all their automation and limitation.I hope you enjoy it as much as I am.-J.

A bit of a learning curve with the first one because with the 7D you really step up from the Rebel line. It forces you to really learn photography and get better images. Nothing wrong with the Rebels I used them for years but when I wanted to delve a little deeper into photography I went with the 7D.

A lot less then 1ds mkII but still quite expensive. But now the price have fallen to around $1200 (for a used unit of course) and its less then current high-end cropped bodies. Sure it cant shoot 7-8 fps but 3 fps is more than enough for 90% of situations and the buffer can hold up to 17 RAW images. I also found autofocus to be very fast and accurate.High iso capabilities are also amazing (and as with all older canon cameras its about 1/3 ev more sensitive than indicated e.g. iso1600 is really iso2000) iso 1600 images can be pushed to iso 6400 (2 stops) and still look nice with some careful post-processing.12 megapixel resolution is adequate for all purposes (unless you make very-very large prints) and require less processing power than huge 21-mp files of eos5d mkII.In my opinion the main cons is cameras vulnerability to dust (on the sensor and in the viewfinder chamber) which can be quiet difficult to remove. It also doesnt feature any kind of liveview system and movie mode but i dont miss these features much.In summary - excellent choice (if you can find used body in good condition).", PostDate = "2023-06-02", Sentitment = "", PositiveValue = 0, NeutralValue = 0, NegativeValue = 0 },

The design is sharp with the unibody chassis showing no panel lines or breaks except on the bottom for the huge panel that covers the internals. Apple gives us a very simple interface with little clutter (and ports) turning what is usually a mindless appliance into a work of art. To further simplify the design they switched to an internal battery for this model instead of having a cover and release bar like in the previous revision.MSRP: $1199PROS:-Excellent battery life-Great build quality-SD-card slot!CONS:-This notebook gets hot!-Good looks poor ergonomics-Slow hard drive13-inch Apple MacBook Pro Specifications:-Mac OS X v10.5.7 (9J3032)-Intel Core 2 Duo P8400 2.26GHz (3MB L2 cache 1066MHz -frontside bus)-2GB 1067MHz DDR3 SDRAM-160GB 5400rpm SATA hard disk drive-13.3 glossy widescreen TFT LED backlit display (1280 x 800)-NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics (256MB of DDR3 shared memory)-8x slot-loading SuperDrive (DVDR DL/DVDRW/CD-RW)-iSight webcam-AirPort Extreme WiFi (IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n)-Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR (Enhanced Data Rate)-Mini DisplayPort Ethernet two USB 2.0 ports (480Mbps) -----FireWire 800 Audio out and microphone in SD-Card reader-Dimensions : 0.95 x 12.78 x 8.94 (H x W x D)-Weight: 4.51 pounds (A bit on the heavy side)-Integrated 58-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery-60W MagSafe power adapter with cable management system", PostDate = "2023-06-03", Sentitment = "", PositiveValue = 0, NeutralValue = 0, NegativeValue = 0 },

At first I was interested in the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x (the top of the line) headphones based on the rave reviews and reasonable price. But after reading and watching lots of comparisons it became obvious to me that the M50x while great-sounding arent precisely flat sounding. The bass is slightly boosted (which is great to many people of course). But the really flat-sounding headphones from Audio-Technicas ATH line are one step below the top: The M40x. And after getting and testing them I can confirm that they are truly flat-sounding. Every frequency in the spectrum sounds very well balanced against each other. And its not that the bass cant be heard or felt. Its also there loud and clear. its just that it doesnt overpower the rest of the instruments.So if you are looking for a set of headphones that reproduces the music source in the most faithful way these are what you need.

Load times are so fast; its almost like instant on when I power it up.Download speeds from PSN are PATHETIC! I have a 30mbs service from my ISP. However my PS4 only reports a download speed of 611kbs. One of the games that came with the system is The Last Of Us; its been downloading for 24 hours and still reports it will be another 99 hours!. My network is hard wired with cat 6 Ethernet. My modem and router and switches are Gigabit rated. At this time the only machine that is active on the internet is the PS4. The PC Pitstop bandwidth speed test reports a download speed of 22mbs. Why cant Sony do any better than a SLOW DSL connection? When I upgraded the HDD; I went to the Sony site to download the latest system software. It was a 700mb download on my PC. It took less than 4 minutes to download. There is something wrong with the PS4 when it comes to connectivity. When attempting to view trailers for games they offer; Sonys videos buffered every 20 seconds. I gave up trying to watch videos of games I was interested in. The trailers are best viewed on a PC. If they were working from the PS4; you can go to the store and purchase the game right there. That inconvenience could nix a possible sale from the impulse buyers among us!Im just getting started with the PS4 and that 500GB HDD is almost half full already. Based on my experience with the PS3; I imagined that 500GB in storage would be plenty. It aint! With only 3 games installed and 30GB of data in Que; itll be over half full!If youve read this far and thinking about putting in a larger HDD: go with a 2TB HDD. Especially if you want to put some music or videos in there. The only data on my HDD right now is all Sony related. Im not sure about the PS4; but the PS3 wont make any playlists unless the music is on the HDD.Like I said in the bottom line; LOTS OF POTENTIAL.

It may record better sound outside of case but then I wouldnt be able to aim it like you can with the case.

The sound quality is superior to the Beats the fit and weight are similarly good. The Sony XM4 head phones have a considerable number of options including an IOS/Andriod optimization app. I am using a apple iphone X with the most current IOS. The battery life is considerable at greater than 20 hours which compares to the 8 hours of my prior beats. The sound cancellation is far superior to the prior Beats however the software is always adapting to the surrounding location movement and ambient sounds causing fluctuations in the external noise suppression causing an external noise source to randomly increase and decline in volume. This issue is primarily an issue with significant and changing external noise sources so not typically an issue. The touch sensitive controls on the side of the head phones works most of the time however I often have issues connecting to an incoming call as it will not transfer to the head phones or respond to the double tap on the touch panel. I have a Samsung smart TV with blue tooth audio connectivity and the audio will break up with the XM4 head phones at a distance of <10 ft I have to disconnect and reconnect a couple of times to correct the problem. The head phones have over the air software updates so Im hopeful some of the annoying issues are resolved with future updates. I dont recommend turning on the Notification and Voice Guide nor to activate the two device linking within the app. I found that when the head phones are permitted to connect to more than one device they will automatically and when linked to two devices the head set can not be used for phone calls. Also the Speak to Chat is useless as it will shut the music off if you sing or speak while playing audio and responds to spurious external noises.", PostDate = "2023-06-06", Sentitment = "", PositiveValue = 0, NeutralValue = 0, NegativeValue = 0 },

It was to be an upgrade from my G11 which the camera fulfills completely. I had been thinking of buying an interchangeable-lens compact camera (4/3 micro 4/3 or mirrorless)  but realized that carrying around two or three lenses with a body might be more than I wanted to mess with. The G11 had worked so well for so many years I decided to stick with the brand and proven G line. The upgrade provides faster focus and shorter time lag after pressing the shutter release. More importantly I shoot almost exclusively with available light. The faster lens (f1.8-2.8 as opposed to the G-11s 2.8-4.5) makes more such shots possible. Still cameras with fixed lenses are a compromise. With an interchangeable-lens system I could have the wide-angle 14mm full-frame-equivalent lens for interior shots of architecture.

The monitor came pretty much right on target for color and clarity right out of the box. I literally turned the brightness down a smidge and done!!! Unbelievable. There is a cool black finished rim and a very very small invisible sort of bezel the picture pops!!! I am impressed. Super easy setup a cable management snap on that works great on the rear a very tough iron looking stand with a really cool almost wrinkle finish. I am a perfectionist and I nit pick looks of cars and things out of control almost. This monitor blew me away. I am in love after probably 30 years of building my own PCs and dealing with many components video cards sound devices keyboards mice and speakers I found one perfect item for my taste. Its super gamey looking thats what I like I love lots of lights and cool logos it all helps me feel ready to win. Its a mental bonus going against the impossible players. I know my equipment is doing its thing while I flounder in the ditches of Battlefield V. I can do my daily work email and watch videos and every screen seems clear and vibrant. The connections allow me to hook up my PS4 Pro XBOX One X and PC all at the same time. Thank You AORUS and no I am not being paid I am not a pro gamer being sponsored and I didnt get a free monitor to test this is all out of my pocket and Im passing this info on to people who love computers and electronics as much as I do but mainly Im sharing my happiness with AORUS who really listened to what some of us really crave perfection design and quality as well as convenience.", PostDate = "2023-06-08", Sentitment = "", PositiveValue = 0, NeutralValue = 0, NegativeValue = 0 },

I write code on these monitors I game on these monitors and I use these monitors with standard applications such as internet and word processing. These monitors can do it all.Trim is narrow on either side so I can stick them very close together and have a virtual 3840x1200 pixel screen (very nice). The monitor can be rotated 90 degrees in addition to the height and tilt adjustment. It doesnt lock into place at the pure horizontal so I needed to use a level to make sure it was straight. Movement is a little granular - it would bounce from one point to another an inch away with no in between unless you fiddled with it. There are variations in the maximum height too - one monitor went 1/8 higher than the others. Nit picks nothing big.Performance for gaming is excellent. No ghosting or lag. Very pleased with them as replacement for my aging 19 4:3 screens. Very bright screen - I had to turn mine down to 90% brightness. All passive - no noise. Menu is a little odd but you get used to it and usually only need to use it the one time. Input source is a single button used for rotating selection - no direct buttons. PLENTY of input connectors. I can hook up almost anything with video to it. No HDMI but that technology became popular after its release so I cant blame it for the lack. It does have DVI though which offer the same image quality just doesnt carry sound. If youre buying this monitor you probably have speakers anyhow. Color/contrast appears good.

I got this camera for a couple hundred dollars below retail and Im excited to keep exploring its functions and getting into more serious photography. The camera kit comes standard with the EFS 18-55mm IS lens which includes an image stabilization system as part of the lens. This is a good standard-zoom lens that gives you some play room to set up your shots but youll definitely want to let that be just the start of your lens collection. With the EOS system itself finding other lenses is just a matter of having the extra cash to invest.One of the biggest debates out there right now in cameras is the big question: Canon or Nikon? Before I bought this camera I went out and did a LOT of research trying to figure out what brand I wanted to invest in and what I should be looking for in the brand. All of the reviewers and photographers Ive read either swear by Canon or by Nikon but what most of them have also said is that between Canon and Nikon it comes down to a matter of what feels best to you - theyre about the same quality when you boil them down to their basics. What made the difference to me was having had no experience with DSLR systems the ease of use that Canon gives you in their systems. Nikons screen display was absolutely confusing to me - I saw a lot of numbers and symbols and things that had I had the users manual I would have been better able to understand. Canon on the other hand had a screen that I was able to figure out after the first 10 seconds of turning the camera on. The display uses LARGE numbers and a simple layout that was much less intimidating than the Nikon.The only thing Id like to see better in this Camera is the shutter sound - if Im shooting wildlife I think Im only going to get off one good shot before spooking any wild animals Im trying to catch. I havent tried this yet but its the feeling Im getting.

You can be killed if one moves on and the screen always follows whoever is in the lead so if your stuck behind and the screen leaves you DEAD!I think it should widen more.WORST PART OF THE GAME: Whenever one grabs a mushroom/power up or gets hit and shrinks the game does the freeze/transformation and this cancels out whatever move others are doing so if your trying to make a huge jump and your friend grabs a shroom or gets hit and shrinks it can make your jump not so high or even cancel the jump.Also I think they should have used the 3rd and 4th player characters Daisy (the other princess) and real Toad.Best advice the A button puts u in a bubble in multiplayer mode so if your about to die use it!

Ive been using Galaxy phones for last 6 years and every year its better than last. S9 is a big leap from S7 line in terms of overall stability and performance. It is a very smooth phone that can handle everything gracefully. Camera is a big change as well from S7 and S8 line up the low light feature and overall picture depth is great.The new shape starting from S8 is much better in my opinion. Removing the home button and making the screen stretch almost all of the face of the phone really makes it stand out. Its like holding a thin glass brick. For that reason black is the color to go with since it will make it look incredibly sleek. On black its hard to tell where the screen ends and body starts.Best of all the android OS integration is done really well. Apps dont hang up or crash transferring stuff from old phone to new one is a breeze...I dont think any other phone comes closer. You just put your S9 next to another galaxy and that its... some how itll detect both phones and start the process to transfer apps settings and data.Battery has kept up for the whole day even when I am playing Last Shelter game for 2-3 hours per day...thats a huge drain on battery.This phone does scratch very easily so invest in a good case AND screen protector.

It allows for easy and safe transportation of the camera however it is not ideal to carry along if you plan on taking it on nature or action shoots.The 16 gigabyte SD card functions well with a relatively swift read speed at 80 MB/s and you can hold several thousand photos or multiple hours of video.An intensive day of photography is not a problem for the battery life of the included rechargeable battery. It can easily last a full day of shooting and can handle multiple days of moderate use. If you have access to a wall outlet the battery charger works relatively fast and can recharge the battery within the hour.The previously described components of the bundle are great accessories however the actual camera is the real deal of the bundle. Some of the specs include an 18.0 Megapixel image sensor which is excellent for speed and quality of capturing photos; ISO 100-6400 allowing agility with shooting in a range of light conditions from low light to bright light; built-in Wi-Fi capabilities making image accessibility and sharing incredibly fluid by making images available through a user friendly application that can be downloaded on a smartphone; high performance optical viewfinder aiding in speedy and accurate focus of the subject of the picture.This bundle is excellent for many levels of photographer from beginner to intermediate. Not only does this bundle provide a complete starting kit it is pre-programmed that makes it user friendly and adjustable to fit the users needs. The 18-55mm lens allows for closer shots while the 75-300mm lens is capable of significant optical zoom allowing you to focus in on subjects that are relatively far from where you are posted. There are also many built in settings that are specialized for different conditions such as portrait landscape action and others which makes photography accessible to beginner photographers and it also has multiple manual setting giving you the option to modify the exact options to fit your needs for the perfect shot.Overall this is a great product if you are wanting to get the hang of photography or ramp up the quality of photos that you do take.

The PS3 can stream Netflix or a private media server you can store movies music and pictures on the HDD and it can play Blurays.But the PS4 isnt the PS3 and when Sony made it they didnt add in the other feature too.

Theres an error message when you want to watch your media server when theres no USB plugged in and you cant listen to your Audio CDs.

                new Review { Id = 2281, ProductId = 29, ProductName = "Video Game Consoles", ReviewText = "I bought this because I got a PS3 pretty late in the console generation (December 2011) after having an Xbox 360 for about 4 years and realizing that I liked playing some games on it more than I liked their Xbox 360 counterparts. I also thought there was a better selection of exclusives (Demons Souls Uncharted The Last of Us Killzone Resistance God of War Infamous Little Big Planet Metal Gear Solid 4 Ratchet and Clank SOCOM etc.) whereas the 360 only had a few (Halo Gears of War Forza Kameo and a few PC ports like Left 4 Dead and The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings). Also generally Sony is just better to its customers than Microsoft is.After hearing about the PS4 getting exclusivity rights to Bloodborne (which is being developed by the same company and with a similar gameplay aesthetic to Demons Souls and Dark Souls) I decided to go with the PS4 as my next-gen console of choice as the Souls series is one of my favorites. The PS4 was also a decent amount cheaper than the Xbox One and had more interesting exclusives to me like Infamous: Second Son and Killzone: Shadowfall. That combined with the fact that TigerDirect was having a flash deal on Ebay where the console was $40 off (and didnt have any sales tax!) convinced me to jump on getting one now instead of later. Plus there were some fantastic looking remasters of PS3 games coming out that looked like they might be worth a buy instead of their original versions namely The Last of Us and Grand Theft Auto V.Unfortunately I have yet to find a reason to purchase a second controller which has left me feeling that the console might as well not even have the option to connect multiple controllers. I grew up playing local multiplayer (especially co-op) with my brother and we have yet to find any games that allow us to play together on the console even though it has been out for almost a year. There are a few like the downloadable title Octodad: Dadliest Catch and the updated version of Injustice: Gods Among Us but neither of us are big fighting game fans and the cooperative portion of Octodad loses its luster after a few playthroughs. As cooperative multiplayer is my favorite part of video games I really hope they eventually give me more of a reason to get a second controller.Another negative thing about the console is that it has a very weak selection of games to appeal to most audiences. I have thus far only purchased two video games (Infamous: Second Son and Killzone: Shadow Fall) for the console. I feel that there arent many more games set to arrive in the coming months and I would really like to build up my library if possible but not much is looking appealing. Itd be cool if they would get some more decent action/shooter games and RPGs out especially since I think they would appeal to a large portion of the people who have a PS4.", PostDate = "2023-06-11", Sentitment = "", PositiveValue = 0, NeutralValue = 0, NegativeValue = 0 },

At the epicenter of the franchise are hundreds of different types of cute cuddly and memorable critters mostly based on real-world animals--and in the world of Pokmon theyre routinely made to beat the stuffing out of each other. Thats a formula for success if ever there were one: combining the worlds love of things that are cute and the worlds love of When Animals Attack. Anything as popular as Pokmon opens itself up to criticism from those with only a superficial knowledge of the material--its tempting to think that any Pokmon product is just for little kids. Yet in fact the original Pokmon games for the Game Boy Color were solid role-playing games on their own merits but with lighthearted themes and some unique twists. The new Pokmon games for the Game Boy Advance dubbed Ruby and Sapphire are pretty similar and likewise can be recommended to anybody. Theyre good looking theyre fun to play and they offer a lot of lasting value and variety though theyre a bit too easy.There are approximately 200 Pokmon waiting to be caught and half of them have never been seen before.As with the original Pokmons Red and Blue the new Pokmons Ruby and Sapphire are for the most part identical. The box covers are different the title screens are different each version has a handful of unique Pokmon that arent available in the other version and a few of the story details differ depending on the version. One version isnt better than the other and since the two are basically the same only the true Pokmon fanatic should even consider getting both--the idea is to convince a buddy of yours to get the opposite version so you can trade Pokmon battle with each other and ultimately catch every last one of the critters which you cant do with just one version of the game.So the good news is you cant go wrong with either version. They play out according to the classical console role-playing game formula. You choose to play as either a boy or a girl name your character and then set out on a lengthy adventure as you attempt to become the greatest Pokmon trainer in the world. Along the way youll visit a number of different towns compete against their top Pokmon trainers talk to a bunch of different people (many of whom give you stuff) fight wild Pokmon on land on the sea and underground race around on a bicycle surf on a Pokmons back and more.

So bad we didnt even continue playing past the first few levels.First of all- its just a little too weird and requires a greater suspension of disbelief than I care for to see Sonic (animated in 3d) interacting with high resolution characters (a la Final Fantasy 12). Too weird for me. Especially when Sonic started carrying Elise. Just looks too strange.Also there wasnt much of a backstory on the original sonic games. It seems like they contrived some sort of weirdo backstory just to insert cut scenes. Which are fantastic quality but sometimes you dont really want to wait 2 minutes to load a 3 second cut scene as part of the storyline.Controlling Sonic is a bit tricky. Even my boyfriend an experienced gamer who prefers realistic racing games said that Sonic was squirrelly- he moves so fast it is very hard to maneuver him. Imagine being the ball inside a pinball machine; that is what it reminded me of.Maybe one day when we get superbored we will pick this game up again.

                new Review { Id = 2722, ProductId = 2, ProductName = "Camcorders", ReviewText = "So I got one of these with the intention of using it on my motorbike helmet in my car and hand held during various different types of events. Ultimately Im a little disappointed.Motorbike: while attached to my helmet using a bunch of extra pieces I had to buy in order to get it positioned properly I came across my first issue. Sound. The microphone on the device (unsurprisingly) picks up little else other than wind noise. I had initially intended to combat this by using a bluetooth microphone however GoPro havent included this feature. You can wirelessly link to your phone for media playback live view and cloud upload but thats it. So my alternative option was to buy the extremely expensive and terrible external mic adapter. This brick of a device enables you to connect a 3.5mm jack microphone to the camera. However its large size small cable and the fact it reduces all waterproof to 0 means it kinda sucks and feels like an after thought feature that no one in development was actually that interested in designing. On top of this IT DOESNT EVEN WORK. There is a special method to getting it to record sound which involves something like turning the camera on with the external adapter plugged in but not the mic then plug the mic in when you are ready to start recording make sure the small screen on the camera is lit up press record and you should get sound. I tried is and a few other variations before I lost a total of nearly 12 hours worth of footage (over 5 attempts and several days) where I was talking about the areas I was riding through such as the peak district but all sound was removed from the video. No voice no engine not even any wind.Car: so in my car I used another attachment I purchased to put the camera on the passenger seat headrest giving the viewer a passengers perspective. The video is great but the sound still sucks. The roar of my cars engine and road noise (Its a Mazda cx-3 not exactly high on the DB counter!) Still beat my voice in clarity and I had to tall quite loudly to be heard over it. You can adjust the noise a bit in editing but from the attempts I tried my voice was very flat lacking bass and basically made me sound like Kermit the frog. Im fairness I didnt spend long toying with this maybe an hour of different settings.Hand held: this is where the device actually has use. Its small size and lightweight design makes it easy to walk around with and shoot things you are looking at or use it on a selfie stick to record yourself while being mobile etc. The sound in natural outdoors isnt too bad but if you are close to a busy road be prepared to spend some time editing the audio in post. As with the other attempts the video is superb. I always filmed in 1080p at various FPS as I have almost no use for anything higher. I have a 4K tv but most of what I want to show will be on things like FB YouTube etc where most devices that use these are HD only. The image stability seems to work and the only downside to using the camera like this is the 90-100 minute recording time on a fixed battery. I beat this by also carrying an external power pack and plugging it in for boosts now and then which just means carrying around another device and cable (and of course eliminates its waterproof rating)So to sum up; if you want a good camera you can use as a simple dash cam with great video quality or to record things where audio isnt such an issue in louder environments this camera will be a great one to consider. If you want to do things more along the lines of motovlogging or require to be heard from a distance greater than 2 feet you may want to look elsewhere", PostDate = "2023-06-14", Sentitment = "", PositiveValue = 0, NeutralValue = 0, NegativeValue = 0 },

I contacted Cannon and the tech recommended I send it to Cannon for repair. I did a little research AFTER taking the camera apart trying to find the defect. I suspected it was in the electronic appeture. I put the camera back together and researched the web for possible answers to why the camera would not function. I found the answer. You have to set the settings to TV or AV Mode turn the camera on then remove the battery from the battry compartment while the camera is on then put the battery back in and turn the camera on again. Repeat this process several times. It took me 20 times before the electronic appeture started to open. Eventually I could start seeing the objects in the view finder meaning the electronic eye was starting to unfreeze. By the 20th time the camera was working. This camera takes pretty good pics and the settings are pretty easy to navigate through. I like the camera now and I use it all the time.

                new Review { Id = 2955, ProductId = 2, ProductName = "Camcorders", ReviewText = "For the price this is a very solid purchase new or used. The key with GoPro is it is nigh on indestructible so even if its used it wont seem like it.The GoPro is a small powerhouse putting out great video pictures you name it. Even at the 3+ (yes I know the 7 exists now) the quality is impressive for most people. It may lack some of the glitzy features of the newer counterparts but it is slightly smaller and much cheaper by now.There are a few key features to think of though before purchasing one. The battery life is quite low but that comes with the territory of the size and image quality. Most times youll get roughly 2 or so hours of time while it is powered on. Obviously lowering quality capture or turning off features will extend this while increasing the load on the camera will decrease this. The positive? It can be charged by USB to a wall plug (needs adapter) or to a PC or laptop so you can charge on the go (granted most cars have USB plugs now too but I cannot confirm it charges in those that link to a music channel in your car).One other slight downside is that the camera requires some form of case or enclosure to mount to anything. The camera itself is smooth on all sides so you have to enclose it in the waterproof case or a different case with mounting gear attached. if you get the accessories bag you will get a case that the camera goes in to mount with. This case is a bit large but it is 100% waterproof. The only issue with the case is when you first put the camera in it is likely to push the buttons on the camera. This only happens when you first close it and is easily fixed.The accessories bag is a huge bonus and makes it so you can Macgyver the camera to work just about anywhere doing anything.Pros:+ Very small+ Fantastic video quality+ Extremely durable+ Easy to charge+ Able to be used just about anywhere+ GoPro Mobile App+ Low Cost (With 4+ versions ahead of this)Cons:- Low battery life- Needs SD card- Bulky case", PostDate = "2023-06-15", Sentitment = "", PositiveValue = 0, NeutralValue = 0, NegativeValue = 0 },

Until now I would shoot process print review prints scan and digitally edit scanned images. Anyone whos done this knows the potential drawbacks to that process. In the end though I got some pretty good finished prints. It was time-consuming and expensive but rewarding. I hesitated to go to digital for years because of the price tag attached to good digital bodies and the problems that the industry had not yet worked out. I was a film snob!After talking to (pestering!) several friends with digital rigs and much research I decided to take the plunge. The Canon Digital Rebel XTi can use my ES lenses (with allowances for format differences) and has most of the features of my Canon Elan IIe (with the most notable exception being eye-controlled focus). Controls are intuitive and easy to access. I found myself reaching for the (CD) manual in only a couple of cases. It can be used as a simple point-and-shoot in auto mode or allows as much creativity as anyone could want with priority modes or full manual control. It even has Depth-of-field preview!I esapecially like being able to change ISO (in any other than auto mode) at any time to suit conditions instead of wasting partial film rolls or having to make allowances for that change...which often meant losing opportunities for shots. Setting changes can be made very easily and quickly and results are very predictable...nicely emulating film use.Ive only shot about 400 frames with this camera and am very much still in the getting acquainted stage with this camera but so far am very pleased with results. I shoot a lot of outdoor and action (everything from wildlife and waterfalls to NASCAR and rock bands!) so I use a wide variety of settings. The only feature that Im still getting comfortable with is the multi-point auto-focus system. So far its too easy to focus on the wrong part of the frame. By the way one nice feature (that my film camera does not have) is the eyepiece diopter adjustment which allows me to adjust for failing eyesight and frame a shot without weaaring glasses!All in all I am thrilled with the purchase and my entry into digital photography. You can certainly buy cameras with more bells and whistles (this camera for instance doesnt shoot video) and Canon has a wide array to choose from including models with higher resolution. The Digital Rebel XTi however is a great value and gives you a more than adequate set of features to stimulate you creative side...or simply shoot great pictures!", PostDate = "2023-06-15", Sentitment = "", PositiveValue = 0, NeutralValue = 0, NegativeValue = 0 },

Better fan better processing just a better system compared to the original launch consoles and some of the mid-level later versions. The flash memory isnt much but you can easily add an aftermarket HDD (dont forget to get the mounting bracket) with upgrade instructions to be found all over the Internet. After my old fat PS3 60GB finally died this year I did a lot of research on the other PS3 models. I knew that I didnt want a used system didnt want to spend more than $150 if I was getting another PS3 and wanted at least a 500GB HDD so that I could shift to only downloaded games. By buying this system for $90 and the 500GB HDD with bracket for another $40 I saved between $50 and $70 from buying a similarly speced out PS3 that was brand new. Mounting and formatting the new HDD took less than an hour and then I was up and running.

They were able to use ever bit of the PS3 power to produce some of the best graphics I have seem on a console ever. It looks so realistic and sounds like you are actually in the battlefield. Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is by far this best in the series and provide some of the best movie scenes ever seem in a game. Now granted there are long cut scenes in the game but if you ever played a Metal Gear game before this is normal. The cut scenes tie in to the game and if you have follow the story form the beginning everything is tied in completely in this last installment. This is a must for Metal Gear fans and PS3 lovers. Definitely Game of the year material and in my opinion game of the year so far. This is a game for people who have follow the series and dont mind a good story if you are a shoot first think later person stick to Halo 3 and Gears of War but it you like a good story and a game which requires thinking like Splinter Cell and Ninja Gadien try Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots you wont be disappointed.", PostDate = "2023-06-15", Sentitment = "", PositiveValue = 0, NeutralValue = 0, NegativeValue = 0 },

This device competes with the newest of the Note series by properly optimizing the software. Games run much longer at a nearly unnoticeable cost to the quality of the image. The sound quality is hard to differentiate from newer Samsung devices with Dolby Atmos which makes that feature seem like an unnecessary name drop.

Takes good pictures for all. Oldest daughter is now in a photography class and is really enjoying the class. This is for her to have a dedicated camera. Have been extremely pleased with camera except for single incident of missing a firmware update that caused electronics to shut down. Fixed by Canon and no further problems. I regularly update GPS computers router etc but never crossed by mind being an old film camera amature photographer to plug up the camera to update its software. Now I check it regularly. Yes the more complex cameras do more for you but this is a basic camera for still photography in a wide variety of conditions and locations. I regularly use this camera to shoot pictures of baseball; then turn around and take indoor pictures of shows without flash. Does both well. Serves the purpose of having a camera comperable to an old film camera to just take pictures. And it does take good pictures.

I miss some artistic options the Sony had but mostly the image quality of the Carl Zeiss lens. Will probably sell this T1i at a loss and go back to Sony for the quality not the speed. In truth I miss my Minoltas. They were simple fast and accurate. Sony is the closest I can come as they bought Minolta. Just dont know why Sony has so much shutter lag.

The Vita or 3DS. The 3D feature on the 3DS is cool but not very practical for gaming in my experience and appeals more to a younger audience. If you are older and want a more graphic intensive gaming experience it is hard to not reccomend the Vita. It truly feels like playing a mini PS3 or xBox 360.While playing the Vita there was a few things I disliked about it. First the battery life lasted only about 3-4 hours playing games and surfing the web. Second it is very bulky and difficult to fit into even a large pocket. Lastly the game library is limited severely. There is only some 60 games on the market currently.Would I reccomend this to a friend? Yes!! This is the best portable gaming device money can buy.

It lets me play any video or audio from my PS3 no matter where I go!Cons:The physical controls are a bit different from the PS1/2/3 controller the buttons are in the same places but there is only one analog stick you cannot compress the analog stick (L3/R3) and it only has one pair of trigger buttons.

A few years later I upgraded to the 160GB Slim model... Now about a year later I upgraded to the 320GB Model and let me tell you I didnt think storage space would make much of a difference but it did.PROS:- 320 GB hard drive huge storage space.- 1080p HD graphics are awesome.- Free PlayStation Network membership.- Countless exclusive titles that will keep you entertained.- Very little to pay after buying the console (unlike the 360 you have to pay yearly to play online)- Blu-Ray / DVD player is installed so you can watch movies in HD- Blue-tooth controller is great design and fits comfortably in your hands.- Worth every penny even if you buy it new at a retailer.CONS:- PSN servers sometimes arent the greatest (especially with older titles) but if you have a decent connection you should be fine.- Installing games sometimes takes up to 10 minutes (depending on the games file size)Overall the best console to own right now.

Blythe said it would probably take me a couple weeks to acclimate to it but it only took a week. And I have never since experienced typing pain. (Ill mention that a couple years ago I typed as fast as 105 wpm at 95% accuracy on this keyboard. So you really can go as fast on this thing as on a normal keyboard possibly faster.)When this model - the 4000 series - came out in 2006 my white one was still working great but the space bar wrist rest and some of the keys had yellowed from constant use. I was able to get a 4000 and Im still using it and it still functions FLAWLESSLY 11 years on although the keys have worn down around the letters from daily constant typing. Shortly after getting one for work I bought one for at home.Im not one whos eager to spend my time writing product reviews (this is only my second ever and its been a few years) but Im deeply indebted to Microsoft for such an incredible lifesaving (not really but its spared my forearms from ruination) product. This evening Im here on eBay looking to purchase another one to replace my home keyboard (also a 4000 whose N key has started to stick occasionally and whose cable is badly frayed from my kids tripping over it countless times all these years). I happened to see the review saying this is a lousy keyboard and it really got my undies in a bunch. I had to right that wrong. : )This keyboard is an incredibly well-built incredibly designed product.

From pressing the power button to first exposure is less than two seconds and most shots with the camera powered up are close to instant. If I pre-focus then shots ARE instant. This is faster than any point-and-shoot digital camera that Ive ever used and only a tiny fraction of a second slower than my film SLRs. The G10 has taken my biggest complaint about digital photography and completely eliminated it. Automatic focus (I use the 9 point AiAF mode) is lightning fast and very accurate in a variety of conditions and other controls and functions are also instantaneous in their use. For instance the zoom control is slow enough that you can easily select the focal length you want but fast enough to respond without lag. Those large dials are also intuitive and faster than any menu. There is even a shortcut button that is user-programmable which I configured for the built-in neutral density filter as I shoot a lot of outdoor portraits and often try for wide aperture to reduce depth of field.One benefit of the 14.7 megapixel sensor that I expected but am still surprised by is the extent to which I can crop and enlarge. I took a photograph of a street scene and later noticed a very small woman pushing a very large motorcycle up a hill in the distance.

If graphics are a big concern for you neither system really bests the other. You can often find online comparisons of games released on both the 360 and PS3 only to find the writers straining to find the tiniest flaws in either version. On 99% of games the difference in quality is so insignificant that you probably wont be able to tell the difference. The Blu Ray drive doesnt really give the PS3 an edge in graphics or anything else (besides the obvious advantage of Blu Ray playback). Yes it allows to store far more data on a single disc but since disc costs virtually nothing to produce 360 games can simply ship with two or more DVDs if necessary.The PS3 also works quite well as a Media Center.

The graphics are fun giving you a whole new appreciation of everyday items like paperclips sticks of gum and even crazy things like teakettles and earth moving equipment. Who would ever have thought the same game would have all these items?The premise is crazy - the stars have been put out from the night sky (in the Japanese version the King of All Cosmos got drunk and went on a bender but in the politically correct US version (:rolleyes:) he just has a bad night. He gives his son the tiny Prince the job of repopulating the sky from the smallest speck of a star to the moon with bonus levels of the various constellations.There are cut scenes of a Japanese family whos father is an astronaut that are very funny and silly because nobody seems to notice the craziness going on around them other than the son (whos very quiet).You start small rolling up objects on the katamari (basically meaning blob) like tacks and paperclips and sticks of gum working your way up to bigger and bigger objects to make a katamari big enough to satisfy the Kings requirement for that particular star. The King is very demanding and woe betide you if your star isnt big enough ... what a mean guy! Eventually the objects you roll up get bigger and bigger and you go from the table to the house to the lawn and eventually into town in search of bigger objects for your katamari until youre rolling up elephants octopi and carnivals.Its funny and surreal and the bonus constellation rounds are based on picking up objects that relate to the particular one youre working on (for example ... youre judged by how many crabs you roll into your crab nebula ... and theyre all over! ... maidens for Virgo ... its all so funny!). The biggest challenge is the moon and good luck to you in the time youre allowed to roll up that much stuff!The things you can explore in the game are fun too ... like an inventory of the objects youve picked up and the places youve been rolling stuff up. It really makes you aware of what a consumer oriented society we live in in some ways.The music is catchy and the game is easy to learn though a challenge to master ... but isnt anything worth mastering fun?I highly recommend it even as a party game ... even the person who claims theyre the most inept at video games will have fun trying to make a star.So why are you still reading this?

I went from a cheap wireless keyboard to a very nice mechanical keyboard (with freakin macro keys yeehaw) and I absolutely love it.MX Blue switches medium travel distance between keys (I got big hands so its not a problem) very nice and tactile feel to the keycaps and even after months of use and gaming the WASD are doesnt feel worn down at all so the keys have a durable finish on them.One of the best things about this keyboard is the integrated USB Type A port on the back. I mean my motherboard has a million USBs on it but its nice to have one so close. Its perfect for a phone or plugging in a controller and I have still yet to try it but Im sure it would work for a flash drive. Not sure if the standard on the port is USB 3 or 2 but I guess it doesnt matter.I know the keyboard is a little dated at this point design wise but damn I love this thing. The backlight dimmer is nice dont care about RGB so the plain white is just fine with me. The keys are really bright at full and at the lowest level its good for playing at night.Honestly I cant find anything I dont like about it. Some more features (admittedly that I dont use much just because I dont) are the volume scroll wheel the media keys like play pause next track etc. as well as the mute audio key and the macros. There are some keys that I still dont know what they do because I havent looked it up. The top left of the keyboard there are keys labeled M1-M3 and MR. They might be for assigning the different macros for different games but I dont know if thats the case good feature.All in all this is an excellent keyboard.

I had the S3 when it came out and the updates are crazy! Screen size is good Its fast lightweight expandable memory waterproof SUPER fast charging (my phone fully charges in 1hr 15min or so with the samsung usb cable) etc... I dont have any complaints except for the front camera. I expected a better front camera on the S7.Its 5 megapixels but the camera makes you look cartoonish or painted with some sort of filter even WITHOUT beauty mode. It gives you this painted look without showing clear details which I find annoying. I googled this issue and it seems to be a popular disadvantage to the phone. Although I did find that it takes the best pictures outside or in well lit areas. My LG G4 had an 8 mp front camera that would blow this S7 out of the water. Its definitely not a terrible camera but to be on the s7 they couldve done so much better.Overall the phone is impeccable.

Upgraded from a EOS 500D and this feels like shooting a camera for the first time. The body is solid the viewfinder is bright and big and coverage is very good as well. Shooting full frame is a bit of a learning curve at first but once you get a feel for how your lenses perform its quite enjoyable. The DOF is more narrow than with APS-C. This camera is fantastic for portrait work. The tracking and AF are a bit slow but who cares unless youre a sports shooter. Color rendition and metering are excellent. Im able to get some fantastic looking portraits with a simple one-light umbrella and this camera.Landscapes are great too although highlight range is limited compared to current Nikon and Sony models. This camera DOES have a high DR option(called HTP or highlight tone priority) but you can only shoot from ISO 200-6400. You also lose a little bit of definition in the shadows but there is a way to get it all- turn on HTP and expose for about 2/3 to a full stop brighter. Highlights are well preserved and the shadows arent so dark that they are noisy. If you shoot JPEGs this probably isnt viable but you wont be doing a lot of post processing anyway (at least like you would with RAW) so you can leave HTP on with 0 EV comp. and still have highlight detail that would otherwise be blown out.Usability is good controls are easy and intuitive although some of the menu items are hidden pretty well (but you can customize them to a favorites tab). I wish Canon was better about making firmware updates or allowing 3rd parties to easily mod the OS. Id love to be able to set up auto-shooting for time lapse videos or at a minimum have an adjustable timer for longer than 30sec exposures.

It maintains a wonderful balance between picture quality and ease of use. The T1i is compatable with a wide range of lenses and filters. While the T1i is easy to use to fully utilize the many features buyers should seriously consider taking a class or two at their local camera shop or Community College.I have used my T1i in both macro photography and extreme telephoto lens use(650-2600mm)...it exceeded my expectations in both areas. The 15mp photo quality is almost an over kill as it allows a user to blow up a unpixelated high quality picture to a size that unless you are printing bill board signs youll never need.The addition of the video capability is a wonderful surprise as well. While I would reccomend this as a bonus feature for those taking still pictures I would caution those wanting to primarily use the video functions over still photoagraphy that they may not be happy. If you are one of those who plans to shoot mostly movies this may not be the camera for you. This is the first DSLR from Cannon with video capacity and as such they may not have it perfected to the quality you will be happy with. If you are however like me and take primarily stills and just want to have the video ability as a bonus...this IS the camera for you.The Cannon name is synonymous with durability and quality. It is a trusted name that has been around since 1937. All in all I highly reccomend this camera.If you are a serious photographer this camera is for you.

The screen and general condition of the laptop are excellent however there are a few components that are not in the best working order. The obvious components that are not in the best condition are the two internal batteries. While one battery has a stated health of about 85% the second battery has a stated health of around 50%. That means I will need a replacement pretty soon but that is somewhat expected in buying a used laptop. One other hardware component that is not in the best shape are the speakers. Upon inspecting the the internals of the laptop I found the two down firing speakers to be damaged. Sound emitted from them is scratchy and the speakers distort if you raise the volume above 50%. This is not a big deal as headphones solve this issue pretty quickly. The LCD screen hinge has a weird kind of click when you close the lid also not a huge problem but worth noting. The power adapter came with a power cable that doesnt seem to properly fit the brick. While power was supplied to the brick removing and replacing the power cable was a bit difficult due to the power cable fit being pretty tight. Easy fix just swapped the power cable for one that fit. The last detail of the laptop and the one I found a bit odd is that the laptop batteries were improperly seated in their internal cavities causing two small bulges at the front and rear of the bottom cover. To fix this I just re-seated the batteries properly into their retaining clips employing the two slots on each side of the battery.

Where it does shine is in the ability to control so many aspects of your shot. Depth of field ISO aperture and exposure. Ive been able to get some very good shots in low light with very little noise. So far Ive only used the stock lens but even with that Ive been able to get some great portraits and landscape shots.Although the camera does let you play with all the settings it performs very well as a point and shot. Just put it in automatic with auto focus and it responds very quickly. There is hardly a lag from when you push the button to when the picture is taken unlike with some point and shoot and cell phone cams.The form factor on this camera is very ideal for carrying. It is smaller and lighter than most DSLs but it fits comfortably in the hand and all the controls are very well placed.All in all if you want a decent camera without breaking the bank Id recommend the Canon EOS Revel XS.

Well I dont keep a light on because the TV and PC lights it up enough. But I do have trouble seeing my keyboard. My laptop keys lights up but since i sit in a recliner I needed a regular keyboard to hold. Well when I got this keyboard I was shocked at how thin it was lightweight it is.. It took a couple days to get used to holding the edge with one hand while I typed on it because the edge is tapered thin.. so not the most comfy but I got used to it quickly. The keys light up but when your not using it they turn off. all you have to do is barely touch the keys and they turn back on. I guess the heat from your hand activates it. But the keyboard can sit on my lap and the lights go off so the heat from my leg doesnt bother it. It came 75% charged and im on day 3 of not charging it yet. So I have yet to plug it in. But that is another pro for me. Its rechargeable. and the charge is supposed to hold for about 10 days per manufacture information. So we will see. But so far I love it. I paid $45 for a refurbished one. I hate spending alot of money on electronics but its totally worth it. I just love the keys lighting up. And the receiver is unified. So I bought a $15 mouse with a unifying receiver as well. I put in one of the receivers and downloaded the Logitech receiver sync program. Once it installed all you have to do is turn off the devices turn them on and boom. Its synced. Now the mouse and keyboard works on one receiver and now I have any extra receiver put up just in case i lose this one. Overall im totally happy. I used Kensington for 6 years and use the same keyboard and mouse and replaced them 3 times with the same model because i was so used to the design but I gave this a shot and now im hooked lol So happy.", PostDate = "2023-06-23", Sentitment = "", PositiveValue = 0, NeutralValue = 0, NegativeValue = 0 },

In my experience with iphones when these internal Lithium batteries reach below 60% they dont hold a charge and will not last a full day.

It upscales normal DVDs so they look better on your HDTV it plays Blue-ray discs very well and offers extra functions that normal players dont have. You can game with it of course and the graphics are phenomenal. You can also surf the web browse content from YouTube Facebook and others. With built-in wireless and Bluetooth you have the same connectivity options as a laptop or media center PC. If you run a free media server app on another PC on your home network the PS3 becomes a Swiss army knife of a media player able to play audio video and view pictures. (and arrange them into albums) Of course you can connect a USB flash or hard drive (only FAT32 format I believe) and play content from there or copy content to the PS3s hard drive if you wish.CONS:-There appears to be a firmware bug such that when you wake it from standby with the controller or power button it shuts down and must be turned off and on. (at least mine does)-Sony being the money-grubbing control freaks that they are have released an update that makes it very difficult to install Linux as a second OS like you used to be able to do. Not a big deal for the average user but I like to tinker and what harm was it doing Sony to leave this? What was Sony getting from this feature other than even more acclaim for an excellent device? It would be a true media-center PC if theyd open up a little.-The wireless (on my model anyway) doesnt support any better encryption than WEP.My speculation: if Sony were to sell an unlocked version of this device for maybe a little more Id buy it. I know that Sony makes money on content and almost gives away the console like printer manufacturers do by selling cheap printers and then making money on the ink but if the PS3 were more open to tinkering it would go from having a large fan base to a cult following.", PostDate = "2023-06-24", Sentitment = "", PositiveValue = 0, NeutralValue = 0, NegativeValue = 0 },

With these features they also pumped the basic career up with earnable game objects but have challenges to unlock if it be on Bass too playing Drums or Singing(this for some killed the game since certain people WILL not notice how i say WILL; play bass or sing some people are just stuck in their own egos)For multiplayer its great with new modes and ability to switch up band members the only downfall is after the 7mounth of being released the populations online have dropped highly mostly now only finding people for Quick play finding 2+ people for RockfestBand VS Band Face-Offs are very low low populated so if achievements are your thing than these 4-6 are going to be hard unless u has friends to boost.)For the Achievements they are pretty up straight and forward some easy some hard. For a small example some hard ones are playing a song as 4 Bass or 4 Vocal (youll understand why these are hard to do if your a GH player from the past lol.... but over all its mostly game play related so you gotta play the game to unlock your skill and knowledge will help unlock more)Overall : very happy when i bought GH5 game play and graphics are soo much better than previous GH titles and over and out-do Rockband games. The DLC which is growing every month has been getting better for selections but still personally am finding lots of people on WT and 5 with no DLC....... fyi my GH5 list is 224songs) And now that you can find the game cheaper and or used at better prices you really cant go wrong unless your not a Music Synth.

Segas blue critter has been around since the 16-bit days when his side-scrolling platformers were strong enough to take on Mario the then-undisputed kingpin of the platforming genre. Sonics fall from grace has been slow starting with a promising first stab at 3D with Sonic Adventure but its all been downhill since those far-gone days and games like this new Sonic the Hedgehog are the culprit. With plenty of bad glitches poor controls and totally lame gameplay on all fronts this ones not going to restore any part of the Hedgehogs name to glory.Sonic the HedgehogscreenshotSonic and the crew are back with a lackluster adventure that isnt worth your time or money.While Sonics name is on the box youll actually spend most of your time playing as other characters. The game is broken up into three different stories: one starring Sonic one starring Shadow and one starring a new hedgehog called Silver. Each of the stories play differently because of the way each hedgehog controls. Sonic is meant to be the fast-moving one and he mainly attacks via a homing jump attack that makes most basic fights as simple as timing presses of the A button to bounce from foe to foe. Silver has telekinesis powers that let him pick up large objects and use his mind to fling them at enemies. Hes not as fast as Sonic but he has the ability to float in the air for brief periods of time letting him cross larger gaps. Shadow the Hedgehog gets his own version of the homing attack but the big difference is that he can drive around in different armed vehicles. Further watering the game down is a heavy supporting cast so even when you pick the Sonic episode youll still occasionally play as Tails and Knuckles. Other Sonic collaborators like Amy Blaze Rouge and E-123 Omega also put in guest appearances. While the character variety might initially seem like a good idea most of them arent too interesting. Tails moves almost painfully slowly and his fake ring bombs arent any fun to use so when Sonic levels occasionally switch over to him its immediately boring. In addition to the single-player levels you can play the game in a two-player split-screen tag mode that attempts to force players to cooperate as you progress through the story. In addition you can go back and play levels youve completed in a battle mode.While you play as many different characters throughout the main game the same structure applies across the board. The games action stages are separated by town portions where youll be able to take on dopey side missions to help out the locals or figure out puzzles to proceed. Each of these side missions are bookended by two sets of loading screens where it first loads up the exact same scene just with different text dialogue then it loads up the actual mission. After that it has to load up some ending text and then load up the out-of-mission version of that part of town.

Also this game has the night and day features which brings back the fond memories of Gold/Silver/Crystal. There are many new Pokemons to catch and you can also have TRIPLE BATTLES. That means you can have 3 Pokemons battling at a time! There is also 2 great new wifi features. One of the ones is Random Battles; in this feature you do not have to put in a friend code or anything you just hit search and the game finds you an opponent and you battle. Another is a new GTS feature; in this GTS you find a random person to trade with without putting any codes in then you can compare Pokemons until you agree to a trade. The storyline is basic Pokemon story where a group of people try taking over the world and you have to save everybody. What makes it fun is all the new features and keeps the game fresh.

Pictures on a 16mgpx camera come out stunning and zooming in to crop does not reveal much if any distortion. I chose this Note 4 device over the newer Note 5 because this one has a removable battery and upgradeable memory card (up to 128gb). Unfortunately Samsung decided to leave out this functionality in all of its premium hero phones for 2015 and instead shifted to a unibody design much like all iPhones. My hope is that 2016 will mark the return of removable batteries and memory cards to Samsung premium devices. You wont be disappointed in the Note 4 and I highly recommend this as the phone to buy right now. It is the same exact screen size as the Note 5 and has the same camera resolution as well.

I had just purchased the new 2408WFP from Dell to take to the office and was appalled at the poor defective condition it was in (and I paid $750 for it  which I will be getting back). I loved my old 2405FPW so much but it had been discontinued for about 2 years.Right now eBay is the only place to still snatch one of these up which I have recently done and my second monitor looks just as great at the one I bought direct from Dell 3 years ago. I just dont get it they made the perfect LCD Screen in the 2405FPW and everything since then has been pretty crappy (even with faster response times HDMI ports HDCP and a higher color gamut). It must be Dell cutting corners because back then they had the right formula when they made the 2405FPW.I plugged in my High Def cable box using the component cables for 1080i clarity and it was a sight to behold. The monitor even has a picture in picture (PIP) so I can use it as a regular computer monitor and have TV playing in a small corner of my huge screen. When Id see my program start or something that would catch my eye I could easily switch to it.Also you cant beat the card reader and USB 2.0 hub this thing has - talk about convenience - How could I possibly throw down money again on a monitor that doesnt have this?!?! It may not seem like a deal-breaker to you but once you use a monitor like this its pure-pain thinking about doing without it. Note: I have an IOGear Keyboard-Video-Monitor (KVM) Switch that I use to switch my monitor between computers. I also bought a separate IOGear USB 2.0 switch to switch the Monitors USB hub as well.I compared the 2405FPW to my recently returned 2408WFP and it made me sick to see how horrible the newer model looked compared to the older one. I spent days tweaking the settings but to no avail. The 2408WFP had very flat and diminished colors compared to my 2405FPW. The 2408WFP also had very noticeable streaking of pixels across the monitor when looking at solid colors and it was noticeably brighter on the left side and darker in the bottom right corner of the screen.So my advice to you if you havent picked up one of these babies yet do so now while you still can.- Miguel", PostDate = "2023-06-27", Sentitment = "", PositiveValue = 0, NeutralValue = 0, NegativeValue = 0 },

Overall color accuracy was excellent.These are IPS panels so there is a slight green-pink shift across the screen but not bad enough to be a problem even with two sitting side by side (right pink butting up against left green).Text on these is excellent maybe even better than my reference monitor (NEC 3090) and the colour gamut is also excellent. They dont get max rating because they lack internal color correction tables (at least accessible to me the factory clearly can adjust them) and their colour gamut isnt quite as good as the 3090.For around $400 - $500 I dont think they have much competition.

                new Review { Id = 5533, ProductId = 29, ProductName = "Video Game Consoles", ReviewText = "Aside from cosmetics the God of War edition of the Playstation Portable is a PSP-2000 model. I looked specifically for this version because not only is it the only red one we can get stateside but it is also a guaranteed TA-088v2 motherboard - the last version that can be used for flash-based homebrewing. Unlike other used PSP-2000s on the market (which may have the TA-088v3 or may not) this one is guaranteed. What is the difference you ask? Enabling homebrew on a TA-088v3 or later motherboard is still possible but there are limitations including:a. Must have official firmware version 5.03 or lower or there is no chance of using customized firmware (CFW).b. Loads CFW into the system RAM not the actual flash memory meaning that every time you shut down the PSP you must re-enable it. Keeping it in sleep mode is fine but this can still be a hassle.CFW aside the differences to the other models is minimal.Compared to the PSP-1000 this version feels more flaky and cheap as the design in mind was to keep things compact+lightweight. The PSP-1000 is certainly more durable. However the speaker location is improved from the 1000 the square button degrading due to slamming into the motherboard internally problem has been fixed and the WLAN switch is moved to a better and less-likely-to-be-broken location. Also the 2000 has the addition of mic input (sold separately through a special headset) and also TV-Output capability allowing you to play PSP games on your TV at 720x480 resolution via composite cable. Other than durability the design is overall significantly improved. The LCD screen is the exact same but the internal RAM increases from 32MB in the 1000 model to 64MB in the 2000 model. Also as the PSP-2000 comes with a 1200mAh battery as compared to the 1000s 1800mAh battery you can expect 4-6 hours of battery time full charge instead of the 8hrs that 1000 produces. Additional batteries with larger storage capacities are available from 3rd parties.Compared to the PSP-3000 the feel is pretty much exactly the same. However the 3000 has a much improved LCD screen (the scan-line problem many early 3000 models faced has been dealt with) that is not only brighter but also provides a much higher contrast and color range. Also the 3000 has a built in mic that the 2000 doesnt. All other features are the same including TV-Output.Aside the model differences the system is amazing. It is capable of not only games but also music video internet browsing Skype and connecting to your PS3 wirelessly and playing PS3 games while away from the PS3. The only gripe that might be had is comfort - hand cramps may occur after prolonged play if you havent adjusted to the system (however there are accessories to alleviate this problem if desired).Even with all of these functions 95% of the reason youre going to buy this console is about the games. The library is huge and expanding. There are many games for fans of all genres and multiplayer ad-hoc is available for many games as well. For a few select ones you are able to play on the Playstation Network against people around the world and with a PS3 you can also play certain games designed for ad-hoc multiplayer only (such as Dissidia: Final Fantasy) and play vs. people gathered on PSN.

Also it is supposed to feel more solid and substantial to hold in your hands than the vita 2. I have heard that the WIFI reception is better in this model than in the vita 2 not sure if thats true. Now onto some disadvantages: The OLED screen will supposedly burn out after a while needing to be replaced. The USB IN port where you plug in the charger or connect it to a PS3 PS4 or PC is a weird proprietary SONY port that will not take any kind of standard USB cable. Finally battery life on the first generation is about an hour less than the vita 2. Oh and accessories may be harder to get and/or more expensive than the vita 2s. These systems are not the same thickness and some of the buttons and the speakers are a different shape. That being said I have almost all of the top rated games and this system is fun. I also love being able to go on the PS store from the vita and browse games themes APPS etc. If you get one Know that this first generation requires a memory card to save any game data. No big deal right? Well the memory cards are proprietary as well- has to be a SONY vita memory card and they arent cheap. I was lucky and found one on closeout brand new in a big box store.

However sometimes in the recorded videos you can see the digital stabilization smoothening out videos more than required and you could spot that in the videos. Havent tried submerging in water yet. Wide angle shots are beautifully captured and does well in sunlight. Howevet low light is its Achilles heel. So dont expect much clear footage in dark. Also having an external CPL filter reduces a lot of glares that could be see during the daytime footage.

The controls are some of my favorite in console flight simulators keeping control simple while still allowing for some almost stomach turning maneuvers.This game is part of the star wars franchise and it provides a great experience offering two brief sets of missions one following Wedge and the other Luke taking place after the attack on the Death Star. What struck me first was that it acts more as a supplement to Rogue Squadron II in that III does not have the major battles of the movies instead providing some of the in between stories like the escape from Yavin and Hoth and also the lesser battles from the movies like the battle over the sarlaac and taking down AT-ATs with a lightsaber and thermal detonator. So if you are looking for the complete star wars experience it is strongly suggested to purchase this game AND Rogue Squadron II or you will miss out on a lot of the story.The mechanical addition to this iteration of the Rogue Squadron series is the third person shooter missions in which the pilots are controlled outside of their vehicles. Though it is very interesting and a new experience the flakey controls poor camera angles and lack of bacta makes these missions more of a painful distraction. I gritted through them and they had their fun moments but the Rogue Squadron games have always been about the dogfights. It also adds AT-ST missions and even an AT-AT mission and while they have questionable controls their firepower makes up for it.Rogue Squadron III has several very nice unlockables two of the classic arcade games several fun unlockable ships including Tie Bombers and the Slave 1 and my favorite mission of all: playing as Arvel Crynyd in his suicidal attack on the Super Star Destroyer.I recommend this game to any fan of the star wars saga and even more so to anyone who prefers playing the rebels in dogfights. However if the dogfights are important it might be better to buy Rogue Squadron II which offers only starfighter combat and follows the major battles (as wedge) more closely. Rogue Squadron III gives a much more enjoyable experience as Luke and once you have a handle of the third person shooter controls can be much more fun as the on-foot and AT-walker missions provide a fun change of pace to the space missions.", PostDate = "2023-06-29", Sentitment = "", PositiveValue = 0, NeutralValue = 0, NegativeValue = 0 },

I guess that gap-less microlens and closer densor-diode really work. Having 18mp on my disposal also helps when cropping smaller object.

This is a prosumer camera and easy enough to use for me since I have progressed with this camera series since the S3. I hate that Canon does not provide a printed user guide or even the option to purchase one. I think they do a great disservice to those who are not familiar with the SX series of Canon cameras. I shoot primarily on AV or TV M (manual) when aperture or speed preferred setting do not provide the desired results. I love the articulated monitor and probably will never purchase another camera without one. I carry my SX50 with me at all times in my modified photo vest.

I bought the Mk3 for improved autofocus over the 6D but really it doesnt do that well.

Well thats fine I guess it makes that difference marginal. You can focus and recompose if youre not close to your subject with the 6D in low light and youll nail focus better. If youre at the minimum distance in low light when focus and recompos wont work the 5D3 might get the shot but a lot of the time +/- 2EV wont find it. They also left out GPS and wifi which I dont care about because they did a terrible job implimenting that in the 6D anyway.

But I decided I wanted to wade in the waters of full frame without paying thousands. After all I am semi professional not a full time job. So I decided to go old school get the Canon 5d.

The player drives Tracys vehicle through the city avoiding snipers and other cars to various locations mentioned in the clues where the action shifts to a side-scrolling adventure game. If the player goes to the right location he will find during the course of his side-scrolling fighting a clue icon that provides additional clues for the case or the player will be able to speak with a character from the comics who give clues. There is one car chase in each level. Once the player has collected enough clues he can drive to the location where the perpetrator is and arrest him.In the side-scrolling mode Tracy can jump duck punch shoot from his pistol or collect more powerful weapons (with limited ammo). These include full-auto Tommy Guns and tear gas the latter of which eliminates all on-screen enemies. If the player shoots unarmed crooks then some of life energy is lost. The game provides two ways to restore health. One if the players is down to 1/2 a life point he can visit one of the police stations and recover an additional half-point. The second requires a first-aid an icon found in some levels that looks like a heartand is used by pressing B and Select at the same time.
